PHASE 1

Tasks that need to be finish ASAP (try to aim for 1 week), as other tasks depend on it
- Box2D contact listener for handling collision (Hong)
- MapBuilder: Save/Load Function (Thijs)
- MapSimulator: Basic structure, see MapBuilder for insight
- MapSimulator HUD, HUD buttons, buttons listener
- MapSimulator function: decrease speed, play/pause, increase speed

Tasks that aren't constraint with other tasks, in no particular order
- MainMenuScreen -> MapBuilder, MapSimulator, Options, Exit (Kamil)
- MapBuilder settings pop up -> Load existing file or start new map with certain settings
- Find assets: sprites, sounds, music
- Manage and implement assets using AssetManager
- MapBuilder function: Multi object selection
- MapBuilder function: Relocate object(s)
- MapBuilder function: delete object (Lilly) (DONE)
- MapBuilder function: Clear all (Lilly)
- MapBuilder function: Undo, Redo
- Research possible algorithms for next phase (exploring, decision, path finding)
- Draft introduction and literature review

Tasks that are not required but nice to have
- Light cone as indicator for agent vision (Hong) (DONE)
- Camera follow agent on click
- Agent path indicator (Hong) (DONE)

PHASE 2
- We probably make use of graph modelling and graph algorithms

Tasks that need to be finish ASAP (try within 1 week), good coding, as other tasks will depend on this foundation
- Simulation environment: working doors/hiding spot/tower (Hong)
- Graph class: build a representation of the map as graph (Hong)
- 2 surveyor types, 1 truder type and their basic behavior
- Research algorithms (explore, path finding, planning)
- Agent communication tools (direct/indirect)
- MapSimulator algorithm menu

Tasks that doesn't really have a time constraint
- Search algorithm: Collaborate Diffusion
- Decision algorithm: MCTS
- Cover algorithm (cover the area as efficient as possible with the available agent)
- Path finding algorithm: Dijkstra
- Path finding algorithm: A*
- Exploring algorithm: Breadth first search
- Exploring algorithm: Depth first search
- Exploring algorithm: Nearest neighbour algorithm?
